Subnetr
----


Welcome! this repo is dedicated to my personal studies of learning
the inner workings of computer networks, the first script here
is still a work in progress howver it has helped me understand 
network address translation a little bit more! 

subnet.py is a script that gives you basic information about 
the properties of IP address and when applied to a subnet mask , 
it tells you the range, network address, and even the number 
of available hosts on the network
